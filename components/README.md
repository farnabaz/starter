# COMPONENTS

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

The components directory contains your Vue.js components. Components are what makes up the different parts of your page and can be reused and imported into your pages, layouts and even other components.

_Nuxt.js doesn't supercharge these components._

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/components).
